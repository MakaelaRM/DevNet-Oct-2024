Overview:
We completed challenge 2 where we made a dashboard to show the latest conditions of the hydroponic system. On this dashboard it displays the latest data input into the Google Drive folder including date/time, pH, EC, PPM, temperature, and humidity. Under these stats, it displays the difference between the current input and the input that was before it to easily tell how the conditions are changing. In addition to this, we added a feature that displays a line graph using all the data in the folder for a specific condition, on the Y axis, and date/time, on the X axis so you can see trends in the data. A sidebar lets you change the condition you want to see visualized in this graph format. Under the graph is the latest image added to the Google Drive folder.
