Overview:
We completed challenge 2 where we made a dashboard to show the latest conditions of the hydroponic system. On this dashboard it displays the latest data inputed into the Google Drive folder including date/time, pH, EC, PPM, temperature, and humidity. Under this it displays the difference between the current input and the input that was before it to easily tell how the conditions are changing. In addition to this we added a feature that displays a line graph using all the data in the folder for a specific condition as the Y axis and date/time as the X axis. A sidebar  allows you to change what condition you want to see visualized in this graph format. Under the graph is the latest image added to the Google Drive folder.
